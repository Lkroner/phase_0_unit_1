*1. 2 Interesting things I did NOT know about the web: 1. The Internet != WWW(World Wide Web). The internet is the networks of net works whereas the WWW is is only one of many applications that have been built on top of the Internet.
The Web is what most people think of as the Internet. It is an information-sharing application that sits on top of the Internet and allows you to read and interact with web pages through a web browser. Web pages = WWW. Interconnected computers that make web pages visible = Internet. 3. Third thing! Most webservers are Linux computers, which now makes since why one would want to know Linux even though it's not commercially popular. Atleast by comsumers. 4. TDL's! Can be bought! For a cool $185,000. Also, did not know the .ly was for Libya, I know lots of sites that have that and always wondered how they got that and where it came from. 5. "Propogation delay" happens when you get a new IP address and when you lose you phone(doh!) and get a new one.

2. Tim Berners-Lee is credited with creating the Web(not the Internet mind you) but WOW. I didn't know that. I plan to look into more of his personal story sometime in the near future.
*2. Things to remember: 1.Establish the purpose of the site. 2.Hosting(who's going to do it?!) and domain name. 3.Will it meet accessiblity/semantic standards and guidelines? 4.Have valid meta data? 5.Have proper character encoding? 
*3.
*4.I liked the web app va website explanation. My new game while surfin gis going to be noting if what I'm using is a website or a web app.
*5. I didn't. I liked the ones listed also. (Would still recommend Try.github.io though, it would still be pertinent in this challenge as well.)
