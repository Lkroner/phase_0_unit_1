*1. My html page is actually a site I built in a HTML/CC class recently that I was aiming to set up as my portfolio, this still might happen, but as you can see it's a work in process. I just completed the course a few weeks ago and they made go through all the exersizes you guys recommended I experiment with so I decided to inject thess html/css files into this exersize. I want to make this page sparkle and glitter and will try and work on it as weeks progress.

*2. HTML is very basic, which can be good and bad. I think it's really approachable and for me as a beginner it was a great place to start, so I love HTML if only for being so friendly. You don't need to a know a whole lot to get going. CSS and Javascript is where is gets trickier(and more fun)!

*3. Since most of this I tackled a couple weeks back, can't say that any aha moments happened this time around. Although it was awesome/satisfying to push all this work to my repo, I was trying to figure out how to do that forever!

*4. I used CodeAcademy and Girl Develop It courses as resources in my case. Also I used jsbin.com to lay down the code before I knew how to use SublimeText2.
