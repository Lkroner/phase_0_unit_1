Hi guys,

Getting around to Challenge #7. I met Arik and Ariel already, but am excited to meet you Premila! Here's my intro questions:

. My name is Lauren 
. I am originally from Pleasant Hill and now live in San Francisco.
. My favorite websites for the moment(excuse my while I get a bit girly): NeedSupply, the BoldItalic, and Modcloth. 
. On the VARK scale I am a multi-modal learner who prefers to have my information through all types to get the best sense of the material presented. I am a Random Concrete thinker which means many things. This link sums up a random concrete thinker pretty well, if you're interested.

Lastly, here is my phase_0 github for you to look at my reflection responses. (Not sure how else we're supposed to look at each others reflection responses? Let me know if you guys have figured out something else.)

Please share this information back as I will need to it complete the 7th challenge and of course I'm here to bounce ideas/questions off of as well.

Best,
Lauren


2. Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.
