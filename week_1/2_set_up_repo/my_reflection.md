## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

*1. To create a repository on Github(you will need to create a github account for this!github.com) you need need to select the "+" button in the right upper hand corner once you have logged into your Github account. Select "New Repository". Name it, select the license type you wish it to have(if any), and select the issues checkbox in the settings(after you've saved) if you'd like other to be able to comment on your work. You will also need to download githubs app on to your computer, so you have access to it locally and remotely. Once you have created the repository and installed the Github app you'll need use the app to clone youe repository to your local computer. Open the Github app select your Github account(which hould appear once you have both app and account set up) and to the right there will be a "Clone to Computer" button. Now you have your repository stored locally and remotely!
*2. Open source(or Free and Open Source Software) means the program is open and accessible for the general public to use for free. It is the practice of sharing how a computer program was made and allowing anyone to customize the program as they see fit.
*3. Feels like utopia to me! But it means you have to be careful about what you make public, and really think about all of the consequences of losing ownership over it(I think this is a good practice in general though.). Which is where licesning comes in. 
*4. Licensing is important for two reasons. 1. It allows you to share your work freely, while also protecting your orginal work via copywrite. 2. It allows you to give certain permissions to everyone, so you don't need to grant them permission individually on a case-by-case basis, which could be exhausting.
*5. I knew nothing about licensing and how it protects yours and others work so this was a great learning topic for me, I have been pretty familiar with open source for awhile so it's nice to know the protections in place that pair with open source(FOSS). I was a bit itimidated by Github/Git, have a lot more to learn but the resources offered were clear and concise.
*6. Yes! http://try.github.io. Great simulator that helped me gain a bit on confidence in git commands. Also fun and well visualized.
