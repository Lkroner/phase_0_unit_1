*1. Questions I asked: <br>
- What is positioning in terms of HTML and CSS? Resource: http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp.
- How do I make text stay absolutely over an image? Resource:http://css-tricks.com/text-blocks-over-image/
<br><br>
*2. Visualizing the difference between padding, margins, and borders was a bit tricky. Drawing out what I wanted things to look like and doing the math for them helped.
<br><br>
*3. A trick I learned was when working with a nav bar, in order to remove the browser default settings, you can set margins and padding to 0. 
<br><br>
*4. I'm 70% confident. I need to spend some extra time familiarizing myself with command line and git commands and some of the more complaex HTML/CSS. I can make things work but it's definitely not second nature. I don't have the time this week but I will do the "Optimize your learning section" next week to get deeper into some CSS! Looking forward to it. 
<br><br>
*5. While I was familiar with most of these HTML/CSS concepts(a few new ones!) it was good to go back over them in the exersize.  
<br><br>
*5. Didn't find anything super tedious.
