## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

*1. I have been meaning to tackle git for sometime so I'm glad it's the first thing we're tackling!! I liked the different materials presented to try and get git. I had a fairly easy time installing git as I used homebrew and setting up git, however the materials helped. The one that helped boost my confidenece the most was the try.gethub.io that Github set up with code school which takes you through most of the git commands and allows you to see how they work in a simulator, which was great for me because I was definitely a bit scared to mess something up on my computer. It also helped visualize the experience a bit more as it showed where these files go as they are moved around. 

*2. Git = Version control. Git as a really awesome version-control software. You download it. It lives locally on your computer. You run it from your terminal. Git is like writing a paper using Word, but other people can be working on that paper as the same time as you and every time you(or anyone else working on it) save that word doc it saves that version of the doc and lets you revert to that version at anytime. GitHub is the exact opposite: it lives remotely, on the Internet. GitHub is an online ‘hub’ that some really smart dudes built so that programmers could share their code remotely and collaborate on projects at the same time. GitHub is a remote entity to which you’re ‘pushing’ (i.e uploading) stuff that would otherwise only exist locally, you’re in good shape. So if the Word doc is git, then Dropbox is Github! You need to save you file to Dropbox if you want to be able to access it outside of your labtop where the document is locally stored. 

Overall differences between Git vs Github:

Git lives locally, on your computer.
GitHub lives remotely, on the Internet
You can store and access your work online, on GitHub, but only if you EXPLICITLY SEND IT THERE — i.e via a git push
What you do locally on your computer doesn’t just magically appear remotely online; you need to create the pathways and make the explicit commands

*3. Version control tracks all verisons of your project and allows you to do two very powerful things: 1. Collaborate: The ability to have many people be working on one document/project from anywhere without over writing each others work! 2. Track and revert changes: Allows you to see changes that have been made, who made them, when they made them, and go back in time to whatever version on the program you choose. 

*4. After learning about git, I can see the many advantages of using version control(git). First off it allows many developers to be working on different parts of one project at the same time with out overwriting the other. It also acts as a "time machine" saving each of your changes and allowing you to go back to previous versions. A powerful tool if you find that you have messed up your code and are not quite sure how that happened. With git you can easily go back to an older, less mucked up version, of your code and start a new. This allows for more experimentation with out the risk of losing vital code.

*5. I think it makes sense to me. Really!
