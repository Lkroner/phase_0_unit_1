*1. Overall it was interesting learning about "design thinking" as a protocol for finding solutions to problems and identifying new opportunities, and "improved future". I am familiar with design thinking but liked reading in depth about the steps and history. The Wiki page was a bit of a dry read but I did learn from it. I did not know there was a difference between design method and design process: Design method are all the techniques, rules or ways of doing thing, process is the way in which these methods come together through actions, events and steps. Also, that sometimes problem shaping is necessary when faced with "wicked problems". Learning to identify these quickly will be a big help moving forward.

*2. I like UX design quite a bit and would love to get good at wireframing. Next week I will play around a bit more with wireframing programs you can use on your computer. I'm never going to make another website without first wireframing!
