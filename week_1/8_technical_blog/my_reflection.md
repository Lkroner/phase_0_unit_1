Blog url: <!-- Blog URL here (remove comment)  -->

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

The process of researching about my favorite websites was actually pretty illuminating as there were some reoccuring words and themes which made me realize what I want and like in a website, like minimalism and simplicity of template with great quality images. I would defintely considering adding black bar to the top of my site if I were to havea blog. I think it helps ground and frame the page and looks clean. I did enjoy this excersize more than I thought I would. Although did sturggle a bit with getting these site pages to show up on github.
