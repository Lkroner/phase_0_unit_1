# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

The DOM is the Document Object Model and basically is just the underlying concept that is used to help organize your webpages. It defines these things:
 * 1. Websites are documents & within this document are a series of images that are defined by their element tags.
 * 2. Objects are nested inside of each other creating a DOM "tree". The branches beign the "nodes".
 * 3. DOM defines the relationship between different elements in your doc. i.e. parent and child nodes.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

I compared my site to this site: www.lizardpudding.com. Obviously mine is a whoooole lot less complex, but I love being able to see all the cool stuff he did and would love to start implement these tricks into my websites.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

Chrome Web Tools is awesome! It's so neat being able to look into the guts of any website you want and also make real time changes, chnages that you can even save and implement. It definitely was a bit tricky for me to get a hang of, the windows and buttons are small and it's an adjustment but the tutorials make it fairly clear.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

The whole DeV Tools tut was an "aha" moment. I have popped Dev Tools up before and always wondered what all of it did. It was so fun and enlightening.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I thought the ones listed did the trick.
