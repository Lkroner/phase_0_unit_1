# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: lkroner.github.io.

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 

So much! Alot of it was review as I studied design in college but I didn't know as much about the UX aspect of design so it was great reading up on that. This makes sense because it is a relatively new practice. It is interesting to me because it's a very scientific approach to design. It isn't just about the preference of the designer but also considers data and feedback from the user's experience that will help shape the design as well. In this way it becomes much more of a conversation and a team effort than a single persons handywork. 


* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

I love working on my site!... However I still have a long ways to go in terms of my design skills. I spent most of my time just reading and absorbing as much as I could before even getting into the nitty-gritty of coding. I want to spend more time on refining my HTML/CSS skills, it was so much fun!

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

My process was something like this: Research > Draw/Visualize > Wire Frame > Code. I spent a lot of time researching through the resources given(as mentioned above) and also looking at other professional portfolios for inspiration. I tried deveop a few concept words and colors for my site so I had a good grasp of the style I was going for. I then spent some time hand-sketching my wireframe, going through several permutations before finding one I liked. I then created a wireframe using google docs to solidfy my ideas. If I had not had to turn in a html file of my wireframe I probably just would have only hand-sketched my wireframe. I find for myself this is the prefered way for me to hash out my ideas.

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

My site, while it is starting to look the way I like it, needs some refining. I will probably spend a lot more time on the CSS. I found some cool selector tricks I would like to try out that I didn't have the time to get around to. Mostly, it just needs some more personality and I can't wait to make it shine. I would also like to maybe reorganize how all my projects are displayed and add a jump up/down button to scroll through them. Those are really neat. I have a vision of how it will work in my head. Just need to spend some more time playing around to execute.

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

Like I mentioned before I found a couple of really neat things out there that I would like to attempt for myself. One was the jump up/down button. I struggle with the :before/:after selector but I would like to practice with that a bit more. Also I found this awesome website that subtly changes color as you move through it's different divs, I'd like to be able to figure out how they did that smoothly because the effect was elegant. One thing that took me FOR-EV-ER to figure out was how to have my nav bar be transparent and fixed without all the items in it stacking on each other. I found that by switching from a nav tag to header tag and adding an ordered list I got around this. I'm still not clear on why so I'll be digging around for what happened there. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Yup!
