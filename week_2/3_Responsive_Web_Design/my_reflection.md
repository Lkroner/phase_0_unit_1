# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

Responsive design is(I picked a few of my favorite explanations):
- "Code design that "<em>responds<em>" to the size of the browser window."" So no matter what device you are on, be it a phone or a destop, the webpage will still keep it's visual continuity and "look good" and be easy to navigate.
- "Design by thinking of the structure of your website, and how different elements fit into the structure." In order to do this you would use a media queries to give your site parameters for each potential browser window size.
Fluid layouts. Using percentages or "ens".

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

Smartphones and tablets are just the tip of the new device iceberg capable of web browsing these days. All these devices have changed the website landscape because of the litany of different sizes of viewports they present. The website can't just have a mobile site because their are so many other sizes it need to adjust to. Mobile browsing is expected to outpace desktop-based access within three to five years. In the near future, any website that wants to be relevant will have to be responsive to all types of devices.

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

They listen to the web! So that your website must be ordered semantically so that they can find things by listening to the order of the website. I think instituations and government websites especially need to be accessible to all as more and more information is pushed online. Everyone deserves the right to information.  

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

Responsive design makes complete sense to me. I'm still a bit intimidated about implementing on my own(all the converting of px to ens! I like my px's!!) but I think it's pertinent and absolutely necessary to know as a web developer.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
