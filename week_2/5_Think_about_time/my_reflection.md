# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

My biggest management issue is keeping all the tasks I need to get done organized into one place. There reflections over here, challenges over there, oh don't forget the pair sessions, GPS and feedback! Phew. I'm a very visual person and when working on a small computer I sometimes lose sight of the larger goals at hand. I also missed my first GPS(which I was super ashamed of) because I had been visually keeping track of it. 

* How will you combat that? 

I realized I need a whole bunch of reminders and a master list to track all these tasks/responsibilties and stay on top of it all. 

* What techniques will you try?

One of the other DBC's posted a google doc that he created which was essentially was the master list I was looking for. So I am using that, I also created a hardcopy calendar that I can refer back to at any time with all my important meetings and a whole bunch of phone reminders for these dates as well. I think that should give me the tools to stay focused on my big picture goals.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

My plan for Phase 0 is to try and get my HTML, CSS and Javascript down as much as possible as I know we will only brush on those subjects breifly after Phase 0 is over. I ideally want to be working over 40 hours a week just to make sure I am putting in enough time in this Phase 0 and really building my skills so I can feel really ready to take on Phase 1.
