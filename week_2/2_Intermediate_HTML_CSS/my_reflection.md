# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad? 

I think web standards, like the document outlining algorithm, are good because they help set a precedent of good practices, which for a beginner like myself are a really good place to start with. That said I do think they are still just guidelines and will and should keep evolving over time. IT's your job as a web developer to know all these new versions though and know if/when/why you're breaking them.

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not? 

It makes sense-ish to me. I definitely need more practice with the whole implicit vs explicit sections and appropriate headings, but I feel like I have a basic understanding of them.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

I do like them as I think they make it much easier to organize for the designer as well as more accessible to the reader. Accessibility and internationality in websites is a big deal and I think making our code more "universal" is a great idea to work toward.

* Why is reset.css necessary? 

It takes everything back to their unaltered settings, so you can start from the "raw" html of you like.

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do? 

I'm typically a Chrome user and have definitely run into problems with visiting older sites that actually display <em>better</em> on older browsers because they were written using older code.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I read into the article "You can still use div"(http://web.archive.org/web/20120622022404/http://html5doctor.com/you-can-still-use-div/), which outlines some great examples where it would be appropriate to use <em>div</em> instead of <em>section, article</em>, etc. This helped my differentiate between all section creaters a bit more.
