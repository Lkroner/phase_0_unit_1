//  My Pseudocode:

1. Create a function called sum
   In the sum function, Loop through an array of numbers
					    Add all indices of the array into a final sum
					    Write the sum 

 2. Create a function called mean
    In the mean function, Loop through an array of numbers
				          Add all the indices in the array into a sum
				          Divide the sum
				          Write the divide/sum output

3. Create a function called median that takes a "values" parameter
   In the median function, Sort "values" and define sort order in sort function.
   					       Create variable "half", Collect sorted "values" length
   					       						   Divide length in half.
   					       						   Round this number down
   					       If "values" length contains remainder
   					        Write the value of the half index
                           Else 
                            Write the arithmetic mean of the two middle indexed numbers of values
