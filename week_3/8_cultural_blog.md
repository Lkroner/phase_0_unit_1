## Release 1: Research

Remember your [Gregorc Thinking Style](http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm) from your pre-Phase 0 work? If you can't remember what you are, retake the [personal thinking style](http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html) quiz. 

Now research your thinking style and consider how you can use your understanding of your thinking style to your advantage at DBC.

Consider your experience in Phase 0 to this point. What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else. If it's related to your learning style, start thinking of strategies to help you. Put some plans of action in place.
